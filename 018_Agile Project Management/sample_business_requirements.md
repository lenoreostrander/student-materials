# Badge finder

## Executive Summary
A security enhancement app that guards on patrol can access information about a persons location.
The app shouldnt slow down a phone's functionality and speed, But it should provide relavant information about finding people who are out in various locations at a job site that requires badge monitoring. such as last door scanned with date and time.

## Business Objectives

The project is important because knowing where people are even while on a patrol is critical to finding the right person when information needs to be delivered to that person.
The basic expectations of the badge finder app is that the user can interact with it and experience little to no lag.
the app it self has a very simple interface so users can type in a badge number and search it's location, or users can use a feature to locate their own badge with a "Lost my Badge button" that guides some one to their badge.
The color format should be basic but also cater to users with color blindness or visual imparements.


## Background

Working at a data center where people use badges to scan through doors I often came across the conundrum that when I needed to locate one of the client site's workers the only option is to contact the office and hope some one can answer in a timely manner. With an app the security guards could use on their cellular device's cutting down on the wait time to locate some one would be time saving.

## Scope

What is included with the project?
-A form of geo location. 
-Smooth interaction so there's minimal glitches or lag when the app loads.

## Functional requirements

For this app it should be in mobile form since it's concept is to be able to take with you info about a persons last badge scan. A smooth running system that has 0 lag would be optimal but it would all depend on phone operating system. So it would need to be compatable with all operating systems that run on mobile devices.
An easy to see color format would need to be applied as well as resizeable buttons for easier use because not every one likes a huge button when they use a device but not every one likes or can see a smaller button that well reguardless of device size. The buttons for functional use would need to be a solid color because opaque is a bit harder to see when a basic color format is used and buttons sometimes tend to be designed to blend in.
since the application will be designed to be feeding live information to your mobile devices it's going to also need to be able to use little battery life but also function at a medium to high performance. And would also need capabilities for the guards to use their own profiles with this app.



## Personnel requirements

This is likely a project best suited for a maximum of 11 people to ensure there are few glitches that may arise. I dont expect the project to be 100% perfect but I do expect a certain level of functionality that keeps it working on a wifi system within the building so no data from the cellular device has to be used.
A basic design is what I'd personally like to see set into place but not 100% bright and flashy just neutral colors. so having a team set up a user friendly appearance is optimal, Having another team for the basical functions and building functions through javascript, and another team creating the user interface with profiles for the individual guards since some would be either supervisors or or the onsite boss.

## Delivery schedule

I expect the general design itself to be at least viewable within 6 weeks, a mock up of how it functions available by the end of 3 months, and hopefully around 6 months have the app it self completed and ready to use.

## Other requirements

Perhaps adding on to the app a function called swipe and show that shows specific doors with a picture associated with that badge, so its not just door numbers with either personnel name or temp badge and a number.

## Assumptions

I assume that using some form of geo location as well as some kind of intergration into the system already in place at the client site. There may be frame works our team does not use.

## Limitations

The expected time frame for project completions is just an estimate since reality is there may be more to just building the app, such as permissions since it would be a type of privacy breach. The initial cost would hopefully be at an agreeable rate number estimate unknown at this time.

## Risks

I do anticipate the project it self being a failure because it seems like it would be a large scale project plus the cost of maintaining 
the project's functionality once it's launched could be a bit unpleasant.

# Badge finder

## Executive Summary
A security enhancement app that guards on patrol can access information about a persons location.
The app shouldnt slow down a phone's functionality and speed, But it should provide relavant information about finding people who are out in various locations at a job site that requires badge monitoring. such as last door scanned with date and time.

## Business Objectives

The project is important because knowing where people are even while on a patrol is critical to finding the right person when information needs to be delivered to that person.
The basic expectations of the badge finder app is that the user can interact with it and experience little to no lag.
the app it self has a very simple interface so users can type in a badge number and search it's location, or users can use a feature to locate their own badge with a "Lost my Badge button" that guides some one to their badge.
The color format should be basic but also cater to users with color blindness or visual imparements.


## Background

Working at a data center where people use badges to scan through doors I often came across the conundrum that when I needed to locate one of the client site's workers the only option is to contact the office and hope some one can answer in a timely manner. With an app the security guards could use on their cellular device's cutting down on the wait time to locate some one would be time saving.

## Scope

What is included with the project?
-A form of geo location. 
-Smooth interaction so there's minimal glitches or lag when the app loads.

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
